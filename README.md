# Golang Learning Path

As a technology enthusiast and someone deeply interested in DevOps, I decided to create my own GitHub repository, which serves not only as my learning workshop, but also as a documentation of my progress in mastering the Go language.

This repository is a testament to my systematic work on expanding my knowledge and practical programming skills in Go, a language increasingly used in DevOps tools due to its efficiency and simplicity.

## The repository's content covers a number of key topics, including:

<ul>
  <li>Goroutines – learning and using concurrency in Go</li>

  <li>Interfaces and structures – understanding the mechanisms of abstraction and code organization</li>

  <li>Garbage Collector – analyzing the operation of automatic memory management</li>

  <li>Functions and context – practical use of functions and context in applications</li>

  <li>Basic calculations and logical tasks – which helped me not only to master the syntax of the language, but also developed the ability to think logically and solve problems</li>
</ul>

## Further development
This repository is being continuously developed and is the foundation of my further education and experiments in the DevOps area. I invite you to familiarize yourself with its contents – it may also be useful for others learning Go or interested in using this language in software engineering practice.
