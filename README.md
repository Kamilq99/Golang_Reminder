# Golang Learning Path

As a technology enthusiast and someone deeply interested in DevOps, I decided to create my own GitHub repository, which serves not only as my learning workshop, but also as a documentation of my progress in mastering the Go language.

This repository is a testament to my systematic work on expanding my knowledge and practical programming skills in Go, a language increasingly used in DevOps tools due to its efficiency and simplicity.
